# STATUS

Current state of the sockerless-cloud repository.

## Snapshot

- **Repository born 2026-08-11** by extraction of `simulators/` (plus the sim
  console UI packages, vendored cloud API specs, sim scripts/hooks, and the
  Firecracker/realexec harness) from the
  [sockerless](https://github.com/e6qu/sockerless) repository, as a fresh
  snapshot without history.
- **Module layout**: `simulator-aws/`, `simulator-gcp/`, `simulator-azure/`
  are separate installable root modules
  (`github.com/e6qu/sockerless-cloud/simulator-<cloud>`); each folds its
  former `shared/` module in as a package. Support modules `realexec/`,
  `ui-auth/`, `testutil/` are required at tagged subdirectory versions —
  no `replace` directives in installable modules, so
  `go install github.com/e6qu/sockerless-cloud/simulator-<cloud>@<tag>` works.
  A repo-root `go.work` wires everything for local development; the
  sdk/cli/terraform test modules keep relative `replace` directives.
- **Console SPAs** build from `ui/` (Bun + Turborepo) and the built `dist/`
  is committed under each `simulator-<cloud>/dist/` so installed binaries
  ship the console.
- **CI** ports the simulator jobs from the sockerless repo: per-cloud lint +
  unit tests, gcp/azure SDK+CLI suites, AWS SDK (4 shards) + CLI (10 shards),
  Terraform (8 shards), UI vitest/typecheck/build, Playwright browser suites,
  dead-code/copy-paste quality gates, spec-freshness and shard-coverage gates,
  and the nightly fuzz workflow.

## Published

- `v0.1.0` tags live for the repository and every module
  (`simulator-{aws,gcp,azure}/v0.1.0`, `realexec/v0.1.0`, `ui-auth/v0.1.0`,
  `testutil/v0.1.0`); the simulator modules carry no replace directives and
  `go install github.com/e6qu/sockerless-cloud/simulator-<cloud>@v0.1.0`
  was verified from a clean module cache for all three clouds, consoles
  embedded.

## Verified locally at extraction time

- `go build` + `go vet` green for all 6 root modules and 9 test modules.
- Unit tests green: simulator-aws (+shared), simulator-gcp, simulator-azure,
  realexec, testutil, ui-auth.
- UI: 12/12 turbo tasks green (build/typecheck/test × 4 packages);
  binaries with embedded consoles serve `/health` and `/ui/`.
- golangci-lint green for all root modules.
